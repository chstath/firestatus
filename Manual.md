Firestatus is a Firefox extension that enables the user to send status updates in various social networks concurrently (concurrently here means that the user types the update only once and sends it to all selected networks). Firestatus currently supports twitter, friendfeed and facebook. Firestatus also receives updates from the selected networks periodically and displays them as notifications.

# Installation/Configuration #
Firestatus is installed by downloading the xpi file as every other Firefox extension. After installation and Firefox restart, the Firestatus icon is displayed in the status bar. By right-clicking on the icon, the menu is displayed.

The “about” item brings the about box with the names of the authors and the url of the program.

The “preferences” item shows the configuration dialog. This consists of three tabs, one for each supported network. In the twitter tab the user can check if she/he wants the twitter functionality enabled (send and/or receive updates) and then enters her/his twitter username/password and the polling interval for checking for updates.

In the friendfeed tab, the user can check if she/he wants the friendfeed functionality enabled (only receive updates) and then enters her/his friendfeed username/remote key and the polling interval for checking for updates.

In the facebook tab, the user can check if she/he wants the facebook functionality enabled (send and/or receive updates) and the polling interval for checking for updates. Facebook authentication works differently and the username/password cannot be given here.

# Sending updates #
The main window is displayed by clicking the icon in the statusbar. The main window consists of two text fields and one checkbox for each service enabled in the preferences window. The first text field is for entering the status text. The second is pre-filled with the url of the currently displayed page. By pressing ok the update will be sent to the selected networks.

# Facebook authentication #
If the user wants to send an update to facebook, she/he has to be authenticated first.
